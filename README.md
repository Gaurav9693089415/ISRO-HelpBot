Here's a professional, clean, and complete `README.md` for your **ISRO HelpBot** project, optimized for both GitHub and PyPI packaging:

---

```markdown
# 🚀 ISRO HelpBot

An AI-powered conversational assistant designed for information retrieval from ISRO's knowledge resources using a Knowledge Graph, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and semantic search. Built for the [ISRO Bharatiya Antariksh Hackathon 2025](https://www.isrohack.in/), this project aims to revolutionize access to space-related information.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔎 **Query Understanding**: Extracts intent and named entities from natural language queries.
- 🧠 **Knowledge Graph Builder**: Builds a semantic knowledge graph from `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.xlsx` documents.
- 🌐 **Geospatial Awareness**: Recognizes and links locations (e.g., "Bay of Bengal", "17°N") from queries and documents.
- 💬 **Frontend Chat UI**: Built using Streamlit with file upload and interactive conversation.
- ⚙️ **Backend API**: FastAPI-powered backend to serve query results via RESTful endpoints.
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**: Real-time performance metrics to assess accuracy and responsiveness.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install isro-helpbot
````

Or clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gaurav9693089415/ISRO-HelpBot.git
cd ISRO-HelpBot
pip install -e .
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 📍 Launch Chatbot UI

```bash
isro-helpbot
```

This opens the Streamlit interface at `http://localhost:8501/`.

### 📍 Run Backend API

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and response latency are automatically logged and can be viewed in the Streamlit sidebar.

---

## 📂 Supported Document Types

* `.txt` – Plain text files
* `.pdf` – Scanned and digital PDFs
* `.docx` – Microsoft Word
* `.xlsx` – Excel Sheets

Uploaded files auto-update the Knowledge Graph.
